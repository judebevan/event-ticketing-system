// Customer class that represents a customer buying tickets from the ticket pool at a specified rate
// The customer retrieves tickets from the ticket pool at a specified rate and buys them
// The customer stops buying tickets when all tickets have been bought
// The customer stops buying tickets when the vendor stops adding tickets
// The customer implements the Runnable interface to be executed by a thread
// OOP feature: Encapsulation - The customer class encapsulates the ticket pool and the customer retrieval rate
// OOP feature: Inheritance - The customer class inherits from the Runnable interface
// OOP feature: Polymorphism - The customer class overrides the run method from the Runnable interface
// OOP feature: Abstraction - The customer class abstracts the behavior of a customer buying tickets
